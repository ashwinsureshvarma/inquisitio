[Meaning Investigation/Reconnaissance in Latin]<br>

Now-a-days in the domain of Cyber Security we are seeing a change in the way hacks are being performed. Recent attacks have shown that the attackers are not out to steal the data but are looking to disrupt services[The attackers use attack vectors that are new and haven't been seen before. Instead of attacking their primary targets directly, they attack less secure vendors. These attackers go through set of steps to finally reach their end goal] <br>

The basic steps to conduct any Cyber Attack are:<br>

Step 1: Reconnaissance<br>
Step 2: Weaponization<br>
Step 3: Delivery<br>
Step 4: Exploitation<br>
Step 5: Installation<br>
Step 6: Command and Control<br>
Step 7: Action on objective<br>

This project mainly focus on what happens during the first step, i.e., Reconnaissance. Recon is an important step in exploring an area to steal confidential information. It also plays a key role in penetration testing. A proper recon would provide detailed information and open doors to attackers for scanning and attacking all the way. It can provide all the critical information, which helps gain access to the networks beyond the internet. In short, a recon is an endless treasure of information prone to attack.<br>

So the final objective is in creation of an information gathering tool that will be used during reconnaissance using Python on Kali Linux that will be build upon existing tools and further feautres incorporated to them.
